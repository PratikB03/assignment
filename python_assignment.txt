Q1. Explain with an example each when to use a for loop and a while loop.
For Loop: Use when you know the number of iterations in advance.

p
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
While Loop: Use when the number of iterations depends on a condition.

python
Copy code
# Example: Print numbers from 1 to 5 using a while loop
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
Q2. Python Program to Print Sum and Product of the First 10 Natural Numbers
Using For Loop:


sum_for = 0
product_for = 1

for i in range(1, 11):
    sum_for += i
    product_for *= i

print(f"Sum using for loop: {sum_for}")
print(f"Product using for loop: {product_for}")
Using While Loop:


sum_while = 0
product_while = 1
i = 1

while i <= 10:
    sum_while += i
    product_while *= i
    i += 1

print(f"Sum using while loop: {sum_while}")
print(f"Product using while loop: {product_while}")

Q3. Python Program to Compute Electricity Bill for a Household
python

units = int(input("Enter the electricity units consumed: "))
bill = 0

if units <= 100:
    bill = units * 4.5
elif units <= 200:
    bill = (100 * 4.5) + (units - 100) * 6
elif units <= 300:
    bill = (100 * 4.5) + (100 * 6) + (units - 200) * 10
else:
    bill = (100 * 4.5) + (100 * 6) + (100 * 10) + (units - 300) * 20

print(f"Total Electricity Bill: Rs. {bill}")
Test Case:

Input: 310
Output: 2250
Q4. Cube Calculation and Divisibility Check
Using For Loop:


numbers = list(range(1, 101))
result_list = []

for num in numbers:
    cube = num ** 3
    if cube % 4 == 0 or cube % 5 == 0:
        result_list.append(num)

print("Numbers whose cubes are divisible by 4 or 5 (For Loop):", result_list)
Using While Loop:

numbers = list(range(1, 101))
result_list = []
i = 0

while i < len(numbers):
    cube = numbers[i] ** 3
    if cube % 4 == 0 or cube % 5 == 0:
        result_list.append(numbers[i])
    i += 1

print("Numbers whose cubes are divisible by 4 or 5 (While Loop):", result_list)

Q5. Filter and Count Vowels in a String

string = "I want to become a data scientist"
vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
vowel_count = 0
vowel_list = []

for char in string:
    if char in vowels:
        vowel_count += 1
        vowel_list.append(char)

print(f"Number of vowels: {vowel_count}")
print(f"Vowels in the string: {vowel_list}")
